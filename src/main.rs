//! Balloon software launcher.
//!
//! This crate contains the main initialization logic for the balloon software. For further
//! development documentation, please refer to the [`os_balloon`](../os_balloon/index.html) crate.
//! OpenStratos is designed to work in a Raspberry Pi model A+, B+, Zero, v2 B or v3 B, but it could
//! work in other Linux-powered devices too with proper configuration.
//!
//! ## Running OpenStratos
//!
//! Running OpenStratos is as simple as installing the latest Rust stable build (preferrably using
//! [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)) and then running `cargo run` in the crate directory. Remember
//! to use `cargo run --release` to compile the software with all optimizations enabled.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! It is possible that the setup you want for OpenStratos is different from the default one.
//! Luckily, OpenStratos supports
//! [Cargo features](http://doc.crates.io/manifest.html#the-features-section) and can be configured
//! and extended easily.
//!
//! Current features are:
//!
//! * **GPS** (`--features="gps"`): Enables GPS monitoring. You will need to provide a serial port
//! and a disable/enable GPIO pin if you want OpenStratos to control the GPS on/off behaviour. The
//! tested and recommended GPS module is the
//! [uBLOX MAX-M8Q](https://store.uputronics.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=84)
//! model. If you wish to use a separate GPS device, or directly not use GPS, you can opt-out to
//! this feature. **Important**: OpenStratos won't have information about location above 1.2km
//! altitude (below that point only if GSM is active). This means that it will not be able to send
//! SMS / telemetry about position and that pictures won't have EXIF information about localization.
//! * **Raspberry Pi camera** (`--features="raspicam"`): Enables the Raspberry Pi camera module.
//! OpenStratos is prepared to work with the Raspberry Pi V2 camera module, but it will work with
//! the V1 version too (you will have to make sure you provide a proper configuration for picture
//! size, as you won't have 8MP available and OpenStratos checks configuration against those 8MP).
//! The software will take pictures at the configured intervals, and add EXIF GPS information if
//! available. It will also record video with the specified configuration. You can opt-out to this
//! feature and use your own external camera, or remove imaging directly. You could also use other
//! kind of camera if using a device different than the Raspberry Pi. If you wish to use a different
//! camera and control it using OpenStratos, you should extend the software adding a driver for that
//! device.
//! * **Adafruit FONA** (`--features="fona"`): Enables Adafruit's FONA GSM module. OpenStratos is
//! prepared to work with Adafruit's FONA GSM module. It will send SMSs in different stages of the
//! flight (check below for more information about SMSs). It will also use GSM localization if no
//! GPS is found, or if the GPS fails (safe mode operation). Furthermore, if configured properly,
//! it will check battery levels of both FONA's battery and the main battery using FONA's on-chip
//! ADC (analog-digital-converter). You can opt-out to this feature, and information will be sent
//! using telemetry module. Nevertheless, it's a good idea to have GSM in case live telemetry fails
//! or a LOS (loss of signal) happens.
//! * **Live transparent serial telemetry** (`--features="telemetry"`): Enables real time telemetry.
//! OpenStratos is capable to send telemetry via a serial device. This can be used with an XBee
//! module in transparent mode, for example, to receive the information via serial in the client
//! (in a laptop computer in the ground, for example).
//! * *TODO: commands?*
//!
//! All these features are enabled by default. You can opt-out to all of them passing the
//! `--no-default-features` flag to Cargo when building / running the software, and enable each of
//! them separatelly. To enable more than one feature, add space between them in the `--features`
//! option. E.g. `--no-default-features --features="gps telemetry"`.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! OpenStratos is highly configurable. Please refer to the
//! [`config`](../os_balloon/config/index.html) module for further information.
//!
//! ## Main logic
//!
//! OpenStratos logic is divided in states, implemented as a type-level state machine. For
//! implementation details, please refer to the [`logic`](../os_balloon/logic/index.html) module.
//!
//! When first powered up, if no state file exists (the software has never run before), the on-board
//! computer will start in initialization mode. Here,it will check for enough available disk space,
//! if the camera is working properly (in case the corresponding feature is enabled), will
//! initialize / reboot GPS and GSM (if they are enabled) and check if the probe has enough battery
//! for the flight (in case the ADC in the Adafruit FONA is configured for that). Once all tests
//! pass, it will start the picture and battery threads, that will take pictures once in a while and
//! log the battery usage respectively. Picture thread will only be started in the case that camera
//! feature is enabled, and battery thread will only log FONA battery if the ADC is not connected to
//! the main battery. FONA feature is required for this. One of the first steps of the
//! initialization, even before running the tests will be to start the system thread. This thread
//! will log information about CPU and RAM usage, along with CPU/GPU temperature.
//!
//! Once the initialization is complete, and if the GPS is enabled, OpenStratos will wait for a GPS
//! fix. Once the GPS fix is acquired, it will first wait 10 seconds for the GPS fix to stabilize,
//! and will then start the camera video recording. Once the camera starts recording properly, it
//! will send an SMS with information about the initialization:
//!
//! ```text
//! Init: OK.
//! Alt: 256 m
//! Lat: 3.2759
//! Lon: 40.1578
//! PDOP: 3.24
//! Sat: 7
//! Fix: OK
//! Main bat: 92%
//! GSM bat: 93%
//! Waiting launch.
//! ```
//!
//! The information in this SMS is the altitude, the latitude, the longitude, the position degree of
//! precission (PDOP), the number of GPS satellites connected, the GPS fix status and the battery
//! capacities. Of course, this content will vary if no GPS is provided. It will try to send it a
//! second time if it fails the first one. Once the SMS is sent, OpenStratos asumes that the balloon
//! could be launched, so it will not stop until landing or critical failure.
//!
//! The on-board computer will now wait for the launch. It will try to get a reasonable precission
//! in altitude to record the launch altitude (to check it later). It will then wait until launch.
//! It will try to detect a rapid ascent, or as a backup, if the current altitude is much higher
//! than the launch altitude (100m with good precission, more if the precission is bad). This will
//! only work if GPS is enabled. If not, it will simply record until the device is manually shut
//! down, OpenStratos will have no way of knowing its state. You will need to provide your own
//! tracking mechanism.
//!
//! Once launched, the balloon will wait for balloon burst. It will first send a launch confirmation
//! SMS so that you can know that the software detected the launch properly, and will then try to
//! send an SMS before loosing network connection, acknowledging that the launch was OK and that it
//! will loose GSM connectivity. This happens before getting to 2km altitude. Once this SMS is sent,
//! the FONA will be shut down and will only be turned on to check the batteries if configured to do
//! so. Burst detection, once again will be done in two steps. It will first try to detect a fast
//! decay in altitude, and if it doesn't, burst will be detected after loosing 1km from the maximum
//! altitude ever reached.
//!
//! Once the balloon bursts, it will no longer take any pictures. The whole descent will be recorded
//! in video (if the camera is enabled). Once the balloon gets to 2.5km altitude, it will turn on
//! the GSM and try to send an SMS. It will try to send SMSs at 2.5km, 1.5km and 500m altitude above
//! sea level. Some/all of them might fail, if the conectivity is poor or if the probe lands higher
//! than any of those marks. It's not a problem, since once the landing is detected, a landed SMS
//! will be sent. Landing is detected if the probe is more or less at the same altitude for a long
//! time (expected descent rate is bigger than 5 m/s).
//!
//! Once the landed SMS is sent properly (it will try to send it as many times as the battery lets
//! it if it fails), it will wait 10 minutes and send another one. This prevents against probe being
//! in movement (could have landed in a river/truck or any other moving element).
//!
//! After both SMSs get sent, the probe shuts down cleanly.
//!
//! ## Safe mode
